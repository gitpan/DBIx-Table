Stuff on my TODO list:

- where clauses should be more powerful than just 'foo = bar' and 'foo IS NULL'.

- Make sure it's 'perl -w' compliant.  Currently doesn't seem to be 100% (it
  was developed for mod_perl applications not running with warnings enabled...)

- Add function prototypes?

- Add can() checking for $self->describe() and $db->XXX(), so that we can
  generate better errors.

- Test suite.
