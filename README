Prerequisites

This module requires Perl 5.005 or later, because it uses pseudohashes.

You're not going to find this useful without a relational database of some sort,
the DBI module, and a DBD driver for your database.  However, none of these
are technically required ;)

At this stage, this module is known to have some mysql-specific behavior.  So
if you use it with another database, it may not work.
